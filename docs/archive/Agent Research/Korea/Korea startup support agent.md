🔥 CRITICAL PAIN POINTS (Where AI Agents Help Most)
1. Documentation Hell
Problem: Each program requires different formats, languages, templates
Specific Requirements:
yamlPre-Startup Package:
  - 사업계획서 (Business Plan): 30-50 pages in Korean
  - 시장분석 (Market Analysis): Korean market data
  - 재무계획 (Financial Plan): Korean accounting standards
  - 팀 소개 (Team Introduction): Korean CVs
  
TIPS:
  - R&D 제안서: Technical proposal in Korean
  - 기술개발계획서: Detailed development roadmap
  - 사업화계획서: Commercialization strategy
  - IP documentation: Patents, utility models
  
K-Startup Grand Challenge:
  - Pitch Deck: 10-15 slides (English initially)
  - Business Plan: Detailed (later stages)
  - Korean Market Entry Strategy: Specific to Korea
  - Team Background: International format
```

**Time Burden:** 40-80 hours per application

---

### **2. Language Barriers**
**Problem:** Most programs require Korean documentation despite serving international startups

**Reality:**
- OASIS: 100% Korean documentation for visa
- TIPS: Korean R&D proposals (government reviewers)
- Challenge! K-Startup: Korean + English
- Pre-Startup: Korean only

**Translation Needs:**
- Business terminology (not just Google Translate)
- Korean business plan format (different structure)
- Korean financial terminology
- Legal/tax Korean terms

---

### **3. Format Confusion**
**Problem:** Korean 사업계획서 ≠ Western Business Plan

**Korean Format (Standard):**
```
1. 사업 개요 (Business Overview)
   - 회사 소개
   - 대표자 소개
   
2. 제품/서비스 (Product/Service)
   - 기술 설명
   - 차별성
   - 지식재산권
   
3. 시장 분석 (Market Analysis)
   - 시장 규모
   - 경쟁사 분석
   - 목표 시장
   
4. 사업화 전략 (Commercialization Strategy)
   - 마케팅 계획
   - 판매 계획
   - 생산 계획
   
5. 재무 계획 (Financial Plan)
   - 3개년 손익계산서
   - 현금흐름표
   - 자금조달계획
   
6. 추진 일정 (Timeline)
   - 단계별 계획
   - 마일스톤

4. Program Navigation
Problem: 100+ programs, overlapping deadlines, unclear eligibility
Example Confusion:

"Am I eligible for TIPS if I haven't raised VC yet?"
"Can I apply to both Pre-Startup and OASIS simultaneously?"
"Which programs accept non-Korean founders?"
"What's the difference between Baby Unicorn and Pre-Unicorn?"


5. Follow-Up Reporting Burden
Problem: Once accepted, monthly/quarterly Korean reports required
Reporting Requirements:

Monthly progress (월별 추진실적)
Quarterly financials (분기별 재무제표)
KPI tracking (핵심성과지표)
Issues/risks (위험요소 보고)
All in Korean government format
