# WonLink AI: Startup Overview & Business Plan

> [!NOTE]
> This document synthesizes the latest "Production Grade" upgrades, including the **Proposal Architect** and **Ledger Logic** agents, into a cohesive business narrative for investors and government evaluators.

## 1. Executive Summary
**WonLink AI** is not just a software tool; it is an **AI Automation Agency** for SMEs and Professional Service Firms. We deploy specialized "AI Employees"—powered by **LangGraph** and **Supabase**—to automate the most complex, high-value workflows: **Government Grant Acquisition** and **B2B Proposal Generation**.

Unlike generic LLM wrappers, WonLink AI agents are **"Production Grade"**: they integrate **Real Market Data** (KOSIS, DART), enforce strict **Government Formats** (PSST, HWP), and utilize **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** verification to ensure 100% reliability for high-stakes business documents.

## 2. The Problem
*   **Complexity Barrier**: Korean government R&D grants (TIPS) and B2B consulting projects require specialized, labor-intensive documentation (PSST standard, HWP format).
*   **Expertise Gap**: SMEs lack the in-house "Grant Managers" or "Sales Engineers" needed to navigate these complex requirements.
*   **"Hallucination" Risk**: Existing AI tools generate plausible but factually incorrect business plans, making them unusable for serious submissions.

## 3. The Solution: "AI Employee" Portfolio
We provide a suite of autonomous agents that work together as a digital workforce.

### A. The Revenue Generators (Front Office)
1.  **R&D Grant Scout**:
    *   **Role**: The "Grant Manager".
    *   **Function**: Proactively monitors government portals, matches startup profiles to eligible grants (e.g., TIPS), and drafts the initial application.
2.  **Proposal Architect (NEW)**:
    *   **Role**: The "B2B Sales Engineer".
    *   **Function**: Ingests RFPs and generates high-value consulting proposals using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**. It cites internal success stories and enforces "Rate Card" logic for automated budgeting.
    *   **Key Upgrade**: "Critic Loop" ensures timelines and budgets are consistent.

### B. The Operations Team (Back Office)
3.  **Business Plan Master**:
    *   **Role**: The "Documentation Specialist".
    *   **Function**: Converts raw ideas into rigorous **PSST (Problem-Solution-Scale-Team)** format.
    *   **Differentiation**: Native **HWP (Hangul Word Processor)** generation—a critical requirement for Korean government submissions.
4.  **Ledger Logic**:
    *   **Role**: The "Financial Analyst".
    *   **Function**: Automates financial reconciliation and projects cash flow based on reliable data.

## 4. Technical Advantage: "Production Grade"
Our stack is built for reliability, moving beyond simple chatbots to engineered systems.

*   **Real Data Integration**:
    *   **Market Size**: Direct API calls to **KOSIS** (Korean Statistical Information Service) for verified TAM/SAM/SOM.
    *   **Competitors**: **dart.fss.or.kr** integration for public company financials.
*   **Reliability Architecture**:
    *   **Orchestration**: **LangGraph** manages stateful, multi-step workflows with "Checkpoints" for human review.
    *   **Verification**: Dedicated "Critic Agents" review outputs against strict rubrics before showing them to users.
*   **Security & Compliance**:
    *   **Supabase** RLS (Row Level Security) ensures strict data isolation.
    *   **Safety Guardian**: Content moderation agent ensures all outputs meet compliance standards.
