Perfect timing. What you want now is **a site + MVP plan that is “AI-native”**, so Google **Antigravity** (or any agentic builder) can immediately start generating **workflows, directives, and UI logic**, not just pages.

Below is a **practical, build-ready package**:

---

# 1️⃣ MVP GOAL (Very Clear)

**The MVP site is NOT:**

* a marketing-heavy website
* a generic SaaS builder
* a demo playground

**The MVP site IS:**

> A **control plane** for agentic systems + a **credible front door** for SMEs.

Think:

* 70% system
* 30% marketing

---

# 2️⃣ MVP SITE STRUCTURE (V1 – Lean but Serious)

## A. Public-Facing (Trust + Clarity)

```
/
├─ /solutions
│   ├─ ai-business-process-systems
│   ├─ ai-knowledge-decision-systems
│   ├─ human-in-the-loop-workflows
│
├─ /how-it-works
├─ /use-cases
├─ /architecture
├─ /pricing (optional, light)
├─ /about
└─ /contact / request-audit
```

### Why this works

* Immediately **signals systems thinking**
* Avoids SEO-agency vibes
* Aligns with your PRD language

---

## B. Authenticated Area (The Real Product)

```
/dashboard
├─ overview
├─ agent-systems
│   ├─ system/:id
│   │   ├─ workflow
│   │   ├─ agents
│   │   ├─ approvals
│   │   ├─ logs
│   │   └─ metrics
│
├─ templates
├─ approvals
├─ integrations
├─ activity-log
└─ settings
```

This is where **Antigravity shines**.

Below are **ready-to-paste directives** you can give Antigravity to generate content + logic.

---

## 🧠 HOMEPAGE – SYSTEM-FIRST

### Antigravity Directive

```
You are building the homepage for an "Agentic Systems Integrator for SMEs".

Goals:
- Communicate deep technical credibility
- Emphasize systems, not chatbots
- Show AI as infrastructure, not content

Tone:
- Confident, calm, non-hype
- Business-first language
- Avoid buzzwords like “revolutionary” or “magic”

Sections:
1. Hero: One-sentence positioning
2. What We Build: Agentic Systems (3 categories)
3. How It Works: 4-step system lifecycle
4. Why This Is Different: Comparison vs tools & chatbots
5. Call to Action: Request an Automation Audit
```

---

## ⚙️ /solutions/ai-business-process-systems

### Directive

```
Explain AI Business Process Systems for SMEs.

Requirements:
- Focus on outcomes (time saved, cost reduced)
- Describe multi-agent roles (manager, specialist, validator)
- Include human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- Use concrete examples (sales ops, reporting, support)

Do NOT:
- Mention SEO or content marketing
- Talk about “AI writing”
```

---

## 🧩 /architecture (IMPORTANT FOR TRUST)

### Directive

```
Create a high-level system architecture page.

Audience:
- SME founders

# 6️⃣ DASHBOARD MVP – ANTIGRAVITY WORKFLOW DIRECTIVES

Now the **real value**.

---

## A. Agent System Creation Flow

### Directive

```
Build a guided workflow to define an Agentic System.

Steps:
1. Business goal selection
2. Process breakdown
3. Agent role assignment
4. Human approval points
5. Integration selection
6. Validation rules
7. Deployment

Each step should:
- Ask structured questions
- Output a machine-readable configuration
```

---

## B. Agent Role Schema (Critical)

### Directive

```
Define an Agent Role object with:

- name
- responsibility
- inputs
- outputs (schema-validated)
- tools allowed
- confidence threshold
- escalation rules
```

This is your **deep-tech signal**.

---

## C. Human-in-the-Loop Queue

### Directive

```
Build an approval queue where:

- AI requests approval for high-risk actions

- All decisions are logged
- Overrides affect future confidence scoring
```

---

## D. Observability Panel

### Directive

```
Create a metrics panel that shows:

- Tasks completed

- System health status

Focus on clarity, not charts.
```

# 9️⃣ WHAT THIS MVP UNLOCKS

With this setup, you can:

* Sell **custom agentic systems**
